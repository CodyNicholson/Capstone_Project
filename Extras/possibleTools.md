# Possible Tools For The Project

- Firebase for authentication

- Apache Tomcat to avoid threads

- Link based authentication

- D3 and p5.js for dataa visualization

- MeteorJS/NodeJS (JavaScript is pretty eay to work with, so I feel like it makes it easy for everyone to contribute)

- ASP.NET MVC 5 and C# for web application development (C# has also been getting a lot of publicity lately and is a valuable skill to learn in 2017)

- TypeScript because it is one of those cutting edge technologies that would be very valuable on a resume should we learn how to implement it

***

#### Please feel free to add whatever you like and we will discuss it asap, and please add a little note mentioning why the tool will be useful since I am sure we will all be inexperienced in something
