    <p class="explanation">
        Enodo is a powerful, simple research tool that connects the scientist to the survey
        and the survey to the subject. <br> <br>

        Enodo's goal is to be a easy to use application for scientists and users alike to
        gather data, take serveys, and view servey results. In order to do this, we start
        by having a scientist create a survey. Anyone, or a select group of people if
        they so choose, may then participate in the survey. After the survey has been
        taken, anyone can view the results, which are shown as data clusters in order
        to easily see relationships between certain demographics. <br> <br>
