#These are our discussed options for tools to use on our projects thus far

- Firebase for authentication

- Apache Tomcat to avoid threads

- Link based authentication

- D3 and p5.js for dataa visualization

- MeteorJS/NodeJS (JavaScript is pretty eay to work with, so I feel like it makes it easy for everyone to contribute)

- ASP.NET MVC 5 for web application development

- TypeScript because it is one of those cutting edge technologies that would be very valuable on a resume should we learn how to implement it

***

####Please feel free to add whatever you like and we will discuss it asap, and please add a litle note mentioning why the tool will be useful since I am sure we will all be inexperienced in something
