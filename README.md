# Enodo - Capstone Project

This is my undergraduate capstone project that counts towards my computer science bachelor's degree at DePaul University. My team included: Tim Abilzade, Brian Hymel, Ermin Memic, Jeremy Hebeda, Rachel Clevenger, Tom Hemming, and myself.

We built a survey taking website for researchers to use to create surveys which they could collect data from. The surveys are lists of options that subjects can order based from their most favorite to their least favorite. Based on this information, we cluster survey takers into groups with similar orders of options for each survey. This data is then visualized in detailed graphs created by our application. Researchers and subjects alike can download this data in the JSON format and use it for whatever they like.

I led this team as the project manager, and participated in the development of this application both on the front-end and the back-end. I created our database, implemented most of our business logic, and most of the front end design save for the data visualization.

The tools I used on this project were: ASP.NET, Entity Framework, C#, JavaScript, CSS, Bootstrap
